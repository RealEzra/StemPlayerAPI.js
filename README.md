# Stem Player API

Allows you to get stems from the official api in your browser by inputting a supported song url.
This is intended to be used with [Stem Player Online](https://github.com/lukew3/stemPlayerOnline)  

## Requirements

Due to stemplayers content policy and browsers not allowing you to set the origin, a proxy must be used for the requests to go through.
Add your proxy on lines 5 and 35 or you can set one up with [Cors Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/)

## Acknowledgements

 - [Nev](https://github.com/0xNev/StemPlayerAPI) created the python version which was used as a guide

## Notes

At some point I plan on rewriting this to use fetch api so it can be used with node or in a browser.
I also plan on adding support for file upload/selecting a file if running on node.
